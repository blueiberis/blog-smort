When we started building **SMORT**, we spent time observing how teams actually use Slack every day. What we noticed was simple—but important. Many AI tools promised faster answers and smarter automation, yet instead of helping teams focus, they often added more noise.

This insight shaped how SMORT was built.

## Why Most AI Tools Fail Teams

Most AI solutions prioritize automation first. They send notifications, reminders, and automated messages. While these can be helpful, they often create more complexity for teams already overloaded with information.  

From our own experience, the real issue wasn’t a lack of automation—it was **repeated questions and constant interruptions**. People were asking the same things every day. The answers already existed in documents or past conversations, yet team members kept getting interrupted.

## SMORT’s Quiet Approach

We chose a different path. **SMORT is designed to reduce noise, not add to it**. It steps in only when it’s genuinely helpful.  

Here’s how SMORT stands apart:

- **Answers repeated questions** using information your team already trusts.
- **Works silently in Slack**, without flooding channels or interrupting conversations.
- **Grounded in your knowledge**, learning directly from internal documents and trusted links rather than generic sources.
- **Supports calm communication**, keeping responses clear, concise, and relevant.

## Built for Real Teams, Inside Slack

We knew that asking teams to change how they work rarely succeeds. Teams live in Slack—it’s where questions are asked and decisions are made. SMORT works **directly in Slack**, helping teams get answers without switching tools.

Every design choice we make comes back to one question:  

> *Does this reduce noise and help teams focus?*  

If the answer is no, we don’t build it.

## Real Problems, Real Solutions

SMORT was built to solve problems we experienced ourselves:  

- Repeated questions  
- Constant interruptions  
- Slow onboarding  
- Difficulty finding accurate information  

If your team struggles with any of these issues, SMORT was built for you. We’re working closely with early teams and continuously improving the product. If this problem feels familiar, we’d love for you to try SMORT and help shape its future.

**Focus matters. Noise doesn’t.** SMORT is here to keep your team in flow, not in notifications.
