Many teams think they have a knowledge problem. The reality? They have an **access problem**.  

Information already exists—it's in documents, onboarding guides, internal policies, and past conversations. The real challenge isn’t creating knowledge; it’s **finding it quickly when it matters**.

### Why Searching Slows Teams Down

In Slack-driven teams, searching often feels slower than asking a teammate directly. Instead of digging through documents or message history, people interrupt others because it **feels faster**. Over time, this behavior becomes the norm—and quietly slows teams down.

Switching between chat tools, documents, and search results fragments focus. Work stalls. Microsoft research shows that **frequent tool switching and searching increases cognitive load and reduces efficiency**.  

This friction is exactly what we aimed to remove.
